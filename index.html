      <h1>Mark Mercer in the Classroom</h1>
      <p>
        In Mark Mercer’s classroom, computer science, networking, and robotics students come first since he believes Computer Science is for everyone. Indeed, he believes computer science is the most powerful tool available and is accessible to everyone. His students engage in Alberta and Canada’s economies of the future. His lessons combine into Advanced Placement projects and exams; Cisco Academy and CompTIA Industry Level certifications; the first ever Networking Practicum experience through Campus EPSB in Computer Science; competitions like Skills Canada in Websites, IT Network Analyst, and Robotics; Iverson Exam, other computer science exams, and other competitions like Technovation and the Edmonton Science Fair; Cyber Security Exams and competitions; field trips to the University of Alberta and NAIT; non-competitive presentations to Faculty at the University of Alberta; non-competitive teams like the Travelling Team who present projects to elementary and junior high students; special projects like a Library Lending Program where students maintain laptops lent like books from the library; and website building where community members like politicians and business people request specific websites from students. Learners go beyond their expectations and own their future by translating their ideas into math, algorithms, and coding they can touch through cell phones and other devices, websites, Sphero robots, and Ozobots. Some students earn part-time jobs exercising these skills in high school. And most importantly, Mr. Mercer encourages many of his lessons to be taught at lower grades, just like he teachers lessons previously only at post-secondary. Technology is the ultimate educational equalizer, and at Queen Elizabeth High School, we leverage technology wisely so students engage in their future, authentically, now.
